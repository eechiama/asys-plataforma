Communication protocol
======================

Data and commands are sent from the uController to MATLAB and vice-versa.

data format:        %data#

- uC Cortex M3
ADC sample is 12bits, so data is two bytes long.
The first one corresponds to the most significant bits.

command format:     $command#

List of commands
================

M1          starts sampling
M0          stops sampling

T1          asks for test signal no. 1 (ecg1)
T2          asks for test signal no. 2 (ecg2)
T3          asks for test signal no. 3 (ecg2 + rand(1,5))
            (T3 is not implemented on kit Infotronic)

C,XXXX.     configures the sample frequency
            XXXX can be 2, 3 or 4 digits

I,X.        configures the ADC's input channel for the kit Infotronic.
            X = 0, 1 or 2
            (Arduino inputs from pin A0 only, this command is not implemented)
