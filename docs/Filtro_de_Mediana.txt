En el Arduino
==============

file:   ap_filtro.h

* Enable/disable the filter
Uncomment/comment the line '#define FILTER'

* Modify the amount of samples taken before applying the median filter
'const byte BUFSIZE = x'
It must be an even number >= 4

NOTE: Remember the median filter is implemented for an even amount of
samples (it sums the central values of the buffer and takes the average).


En el LPC1769
==============

file:   PR_ADC.h

constant:   #define SIZE

* To disable the median filter set SIZE to 1

* To modify the amount of samples taken before applying the median filter set
SIZE to your liking. It must be an even number >= 4

NOTE: Remember the median filter is implemented for an even amount of
samples (it sums the central values of the buffer and takes the average).


En el script de la app de MATLAB
=================================

variable:   info.MedianaSize
(On the main script)

This value is used to set the correct step (dt) between samples at the time of
plotting.

* If the filter is not applied, set the variable to 1.
* Otherwise, set it to the amount of samples taken to calculate the median.
