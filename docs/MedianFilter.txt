* Enable/disable the median filter
Uncomment/comment the line '#define FILTER'

* Modify the amount of samples taken before applying the median filter
'const byte BUFSIZE = x'
NOTE: x must be an even number >= 4

constant:   #define SIZE

* To disable the median filter set SIZE to 1

* To modify the amount of samples taken before applying the median filter set
SIZE to your liking.
NOTE: it must be an even number >= 4

MATLAB Script
=============

variable:   info.MedianaSize
On the main script

This value is used to set the correct step (dt) between samples at the time of
plotting.

* If the filter is not applied, set the variable to 1.
* Otherwise, set it to the amount of samples taken to calculate the median.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The NOTES are because the median filter is implemented for an even amount of
samples (it sums the central values of the buffer and takes the average).
