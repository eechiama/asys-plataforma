F(Timer clk) = SysClk / prescaler
                                 
Fast PWM mode
==============

The PWM cycle takes 256 ticks.

Fpwm = F(Timer clk)  *   1 cycle
               		 256 ticks

Fpwm = 16M / ( 1 * 256 ) = 62.5 kHz

62500 PWM values per second.

Take a sine wave and sample a cycle on 125 points.

62500 values * 1 cycle    = 500 cycles
       sec    125 values         sec

We get 500 cycles per second of the 125-point sine wave.


Generating different frequencies of the signal
================================================

The Fpwm is a multiple of the sine frequency we want.
There are 2 ways to modify the frequency of the signal:

- Constitue the LUT table of the signal with a different amount of points.
For example, a 500 point LUT table of a sine wave would generate a 125 Hz signal.
(Not flexible, not recommended)

- Instead of updating the duty cicle on each pwm cycle, do it on multiples of it.
Say, with a static counter on ISR.
(modifying the frequency without making a new LUT table!)

For example: With different count values we have
500/10 = 50 Hz
500/5 = 100 Hz
500/4 = 125 Hz
500/2 = 250 Hz
