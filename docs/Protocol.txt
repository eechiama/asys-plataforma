Communication protocol
=======================

Data and commands are sent from the uController to MATLAB and vice-versa.

data format:        %data#

For both micros data is 2 bytes long. The first one corresponds to the most
significant bits.

- uC Cortex M3: ADC 12bits
- uC ATmega328p: ADC 10bits


command format:     $command#


commands common for both uC
===========================

M1          starts sampling
M0          stops sampling

C,XXXX.     configures the sample frequency
            XXXX can be 2, 3 or 4 digits

T1          asks for test signal no. 1 (ecg1)
T2          asks for test signal no. 2 (ecg2)


commands exclusive to the cortex-m3
====================================

I,X.        configures the ADC's input channel for the kit Infotronic.
            X = 0, 1 or 2


commands exclusive to the ATmega328p
====================================

T3          asks for test signal no. 3 (ecg2 + rand(1,5))

P1,X,YY.    activates PWM output
            with modulated waveform X,
            with it's frequency divided by YY (can be 1 or 2 digits)

            The waveforms (X) can be:
            S   sine wave 500Hz
            Q   square wave 500Hz
            R   ramp function 245Hz
            H   logic HIGH voltage
            E   electro-cardiogram (test signal ECG2)

            Frequency divisor YY can be 1 or 2 digits long.
            It should be a number on the range of [1-99].

P0          turns off the PWM output.
