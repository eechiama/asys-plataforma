Timer clock:    F(Timer clk) = SysClk
                              ---------
                              prescaler


Fast PWM mode:  the PWM cycle takes 256 ticks

Fpwm = Tclk  *   1 cycle
                ---------
                256 ticks

[ Fpwm ] = pwm cycles per second (frequency of pwm)



Fpwm = 16M / ( 1 * 256 ) = 62.5 kHz

62500 PWM values per second.

Take a sine wave and sample a cycle on 125 points.

62500 values * 1 cycle    = 500 cycles
       sec    125 values         sec

We get 500 cycles per second of the 125-point sine wave.


The Fpwm is a multiple of the sine frequency we want.

But you can also modify the frequency without making a new LUT table.
Instead of updating the duty cicle on each pwm cycle, do it on multiples of it.
Say, with a static counter on ISR.

For example: With different count values we have
500/10 = 50 Hz
500/5 = 100 Hz
500/4 = 125 Hz
500/2 = 250 Hz
